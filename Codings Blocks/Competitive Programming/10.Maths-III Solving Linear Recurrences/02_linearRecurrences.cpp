/*
Problems involving Linear Recurrences:

f(i) = f(i-1) + f(i-2) + f(i-4)
nth term of the recurrence

LR is a function in which each term of the sequence is a linear
combination of previous terms.

recursion -> O(2^n)
DP -> O(N)
Matrix Exponentiation -> O(K^3(log(n)))

steps:
1. Find the value of k
